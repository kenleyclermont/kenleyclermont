### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Ken!

I am a software developer passionate about building innovative solutions. Currently, I contribute to the [huntscript](https://github.com/huntscript/) project.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on desktop/mobile/web application projects using Android Studio and Visual Studio Community.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m in the process of mastering C++ programming and exploring the possibilities of .NET MAUI.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m enthusiastic about collaborating on exciting Mobile Application projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m seeking assistance with working on APIs, so if you have expertise in this area, let's connect!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about programming.
- ðŸ“« Reach me at: [kenleyclermont5@gmail.com](mailto:kenleyclermont5@gmail.com)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I never really enjoyed programming until I discovered the incredible things I can build with it. Now, I'm hooked on turning ideas into reality through code!

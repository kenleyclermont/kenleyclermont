### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Ken!

I am a software engineer, introverted artist, and book enthusiast. Currently, I am leading the software engineering efforts for the [huntscript](https://github.com/huntscript/) initiative.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on software application projects using Android Studio and Visual Studio.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m improving my software engineering skills through MIT OpenCourseWare: [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m enthusiastic about collaborating on exciting mobile application projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me anything about programming.
- ðŸ“« Reach me at: [kenleyclermont5@gmail.com](mailto:kenleyclermont5@gmail.com)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I never truly enjoyed programming until I discovered the incredible things I can build with it. Now, I'm hooked on turning ideas into reality through code!
